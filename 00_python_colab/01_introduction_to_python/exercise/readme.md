## ðŸ§¾ Use Case 1: Student Information Card:

Welcome to your first Python practice assignment!
Youâ€™ll complete two simple, real-world programs using the topics you learned today:

* Variables
* Data Types (int, float, str)
* The print() Function
* Understanding how Python executes step by step

---

ðŸ§¾ Use Case 1: Student Information Card

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Create a program that stores and displays a studentâ€™s basic information.

ðŸ§  Instructions

**1. Create variables for:**

   * student_name (string)
   * student_age (integer)
   * student_grade (string)
   * student_gpa (float)

**2. Print Information in neat and clear structure:**

   **Student Information Card:**
   Name: Ali Khan
   Age: 16
   Grade: 10th
   GPA: 3.8

**3. Make sure to:**

   * Use different data types correctly (int, float, str)
   * Use the print() function to display output

**ðŸ’¡ Bonus Challenge (Optional):**
Combine variables with text in one line using print():

print(student_name, "is", student_age, "years old and currently in", student_grade, "grade.")

**Expected Output:**
Ali Khan is 16 years old and currently in 10th grade.

## â˜• Use Case 2: CafÃ© Bill Generator

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**
Create a simple Python program that calculates and displays a customerâ€™s cafÃ© bill.

**ðŸ§  Instructions**

1. Create variables for:

   * coffee_price (float)
   * sandwich_price (float)
   * cake_price (float)
   * customer_name (string)

2. Calculate the total bill using addition.

3. Print the output in this format:
   **CafÃ© Bill**

   Customer Name: Ayesha
   Coffee: $2.5
   Sandwich: $4.0
   Cake: $3.0

   Total Bill: $9.5

## **ðŸ’¡ Bonus Challenge (Optional)**
Add a line that thanks the customer:

print("Thank you for visiting our cafÃ©,", customer_name + "!")

Expected Output:
Thank you for visiting our cafÃ©, Ayesha!

**âœ… Learning Outcomes**

By completing both use cases, you will:

* Practice declaring and using variables
* Work with different data types (int, float, str)
* Understand how Python executes code step by step through its interpreter
* Learn to print clean, readable output

---

**ðŸ§© Tip**
Experiment with changing the values of your variables â€” see how the results change instantly when you re-run your program. Thatâ€™s the power of Pythonâ€™s interpreted nature!
